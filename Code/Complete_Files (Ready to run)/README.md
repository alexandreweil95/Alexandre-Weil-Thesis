The two files in this folder contain all the code used in this thesis. Those files are ready to be ran provided that the paths are adapted to fit the path structure of the cluster on which they will be used. For each file, only uncomment the model that you want to train and obtain visualization tools for.

If one prefers to use individual files, those can be found in the folder called "Individual_Files".
